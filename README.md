# SPOTIFY-CLONE

I developed a full-stack Spotify Clone using the MERN stack, aiming to replicate the core functionalities of the original Spotify platform with a smooth, responsive, and modern user experience. The frontend was built using React.js and Tailwind CSS, closely mimicking Spotify’s UI in terms of layout, color schemes, and interactive elements. The backend was developed with Node.js and Express.js, while MongoDB served as the database for storing user information, playlists, and track metadata.

One of the key features of this project is secure user authentication, implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Only authenticated users can access the dashboard, add music, or manage playlists. Once logged in, users can upload songs through an integrated Cloudinary service, which securely hosts music files and ensures high-speed, buffer-free playback through their global CDN. This integration allowed me to manage audio files dynamically without overloading the backend.

The application supports playlist management, where users can create, view, edit, and delete playlists. Each playlist can be populated with uploaded songs and played back through a custom-built audio player. The player supports basic playback controls and is designed for a seamless experience across devices. The entire platform is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, enhancing usability across different screen sizes.

This project allowed me to explore full-stack architecture, real-time media delivery, secure user sessions, and user-centric design. It showcases my ability to independently build scalable and feature-rich applications with modern web technologies.I developed a full-stack Spotify Clone using the MERN stack, aiming to replicate the core functionalities of the original Spotify platform with a smooth, responsive, and modern user experience.
